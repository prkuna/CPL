# CPL
Computer Programing Language

### Terminology:
- Python, Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic, Perl, JavaScript, and many more are high-level language intended to be relatively straightforward for humans to read and write and for computers to read and process.
- The actual hardware inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) does not understand any of these high-level languages.
- The CPU understands a language we call machine language. Machine language is very simple and tiresome to write because it is represented all in zeros and ones: "001010001110100100101010000001111". So we build various translators to allow programmers to write in high-level languages and these translators convert the programs to machine language for actual execution by the CPU.
- Since machine language is tied to the computer hardware, machine language is not portable across different types of hardware. Programs written in high-level languages can be moved between different computers by using a different interpreter on the new machine or recompiling the code to create a machine language version of the program for the new machine.
- These programming language translators fall into two general categories: (1) interpreters and (2) compilers.
- It is not easy to read or write machine language, so it is nice that we have interpreters and compilers that allow us to write in high-level languages.
